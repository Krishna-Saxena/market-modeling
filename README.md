# market-modeling

## The Public Repository for my ACMS honors thesis *The Market of Learning*

This repo is intended to be a starting point for anyone who wants to research timeseries processes.

I will post periodic updates on [my blog](https://medium.com/@krishna-saxena) which will explain how to use the repo and the math behind the utilities I make.

### Run Me
I will add a new file to the [./examples](https://github.com/Krishna-Saxena/market-modeling/tree/main/examples) folder every log.

There are **just three steps** needed to get started 

1. install `requirements.txt` using your favorite package manager (i.e., run `conda install --yes --file requirements.txt` in command line)
2. run all the cells in [./examples/collect_data](https://github.com/Krishna-Saxena/market-modeling/tree/main/examples/collect_data.ipynb)
3. run any of the other notebooks in [./examples](https://github.com/Krishna-Saxena/market-modeling/tree/main/examples)
